This is the source code for my website.

As of now (201025) I am converting my site from Wix to my own server.

Because my website was created using Wix, I have to re-write all of the code.

I have a little less than 3 years to complete this project (when i have to refresh my "business" plan with Wix)

Enjoy the journey (I guess)
